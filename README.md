## Warnings
* Loss of data may occur, back up anything you do not want to be lost
  * Using these testing builds on worlds/saves may have unforseeable consequences, use at your own risk
  * I am not responsible for any data lost and/or corrupted
* These builds are not guarunteed to be stable, frequent errors and crashing may occur
* Any feature present in a testing release is not guarenteed to be in the final release
* Testing releases are built on a different system and way than our previous releases
  * This means there may be issues that prevent **launching** MCEdit-Unified, report these issue to **this** Github
    * Any other issues should be reported to the usual [MCEdit-Unified Github](https://github.com/Khroki/MCEdit-Unified)
  * I may not be able to fix any/all startup issues
* These builds have update notifications disabled, so check regularly for new testing builds. 
  * Submitting a bug with an older version will cause a delay in verifying it and may result in the bug report being closed immediately until the bug is reported on the current testing version 
  
## FAQ
* Why aren't there any Mac OS X testing releases?
  * There are CI systems out there that support building on Mac OS X, however I do not have access to a Mac, so I am not able to personally test/verify that the build worked. Thus, I cannot be sure that the Mac OS X testing builds would even work on other computers. There may be testing builds for Mac OS X in the future, but I cannot promise anything. If you would like to help add Mac builds, open an issue!
  
* How long will the support of a testing\bug reporting window of a build last?
  * Until a new testing build is released
  
* Do I have to signup anywhere to test these builds?
  * No, but I ask you to read the Warnings section above and to report any/all bugs or errors that you encounter as soon as you can along with the steps to reproduce
  
* What is changed between testing builds?
  * Changelogs are not automatically generated, so changes have to be manually added after every build. This will take some time, so please be patient if you don't see a changelog immediately after a build
